# Nishimwe Prince Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio and resume website for Nishimwe Prince, Full Stack Developer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), it showcases professional experience, projects, and contact information in a clean, modern layout.

## Main Features

- **Fixed Sidebar & Navbar:** Sidebar (with contact and summary) and navbar (with navigation links) are always visible while scrolling, improving navigation and accessibility.
- **Experience Section:** Detailed professional experience, rendered from a structured data source.
- **Projects Section:** Recent and notable projects, each with stack, links, and documentation, styled similarly to the experience section.
- **Responsive, Dark-Themed Layout:** Uses Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible, and mobile-friendly design.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components (Header, Sidebar, ExperienceList, ProjectsList, etc.).
- `src/constants/`: Contains structured data for experiences and projects.
- `src/app/`: Contains the main pages and routing logic for the site.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** for app structure and routing
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling (using the new `@import "tailwindcss";` directive)
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Recent Improvements
